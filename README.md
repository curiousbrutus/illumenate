# Illumenate

Illumenate is an Android application exploring how music-driven flashlight patterns may support digital wellbeing and cognitive states. As a cognitive neuropsychologist, youâ€™re applying brain-computer interface (BCI) principles to study the potential of audiovisual entrainment.

## Vision & Purpose
- Fuse neuroscience insights with user-friendly mobile tech
- Investigate the influence of synchronized light and sound on mood and cognition
- Provide a foundation for deeper BCI integration

## Core Features
- Music-based BPM detection for dynamic light patterns
- Real-time flashlight control using Camera2 API
- Strobe frequencies tailored to various musical intensities
- Epilepsy and sensitivity precautions

## Why It Matters
- May assist in relaxation, focus, or mindful states
- Sparks interdisciplinary research in cognitive neuroscience, BCI, and digital wellbeing
- Encourages data-driven insight into sensory stimulation effects

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and open in Android Studio.
2. Grant camera and storage permissions on your device.
3. Select a music file, detect its BPM, and enjoy the synchronized light show.

## Roadmap
- Expanded BPM analysis and customization controls
- Potential integration with wearables or EEG-based devices
- Unified data collection to advance user wellbeing research

## Contributing
Contributions are invited from scientists, engineers, and wellbeing advocates:
- Submit pull requests, propose features, or report issues
- Help refine BPM detection, lighting patterns, or UI
